## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I have learned alot in this challenge. I have learned CSS media queries, as well as CSS position grid, although they are quite confusing at times, but with time I will master them very well. I have also learned on how to debug my codes using chrome console tool.




### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on CSS positions; absolute and relative. I am quite not comfortable with this two CSS properties. It sometimes get abit confusing. This two techniques are very useful therefore I would like to perfect it


### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me with media queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
